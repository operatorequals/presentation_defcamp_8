### TL;D[R/W] (`T`oo `L`ong ;`D`idn't [`R`ead/`W`atched])
The whole thing starts with the classic argument about **how this thing is different from other similar ones** and **why we need another of those**. Turns out that many things are missing from classic `R`emote `A`dministration `T`ools, mostly connectivity wise.

A Design class about how a backdoor (`RAT` *Agent/Handler* pair) is structured follows. Parts, components and their jobs are explained and demonstrated.

Presentation of `covertutils`, a Python package for *Developing Backdoors*. Contains demonstration of package features, points about the inner mechanics of the package, design decisions and a coding example ([available @ ReadTheDocs](http://covertutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prog_examples.html#simple-tcp-bind-shell)).

A brief ancore with an ICMP real world case ([available @ ReadTheDocs](http://covertutils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prog_examples.html#advanced-icmp-bind-shell)) and the traffic analysis of it. A backdoor totally resembling a Ping network traffic between hosts.
